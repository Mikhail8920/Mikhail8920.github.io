                        <p>In 1993, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore, upstream of 
                            Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames or reached a now lost island in it. 
                            Two of those timbers were radiocarbon dated to between 1750 BC and 1285 BC.</p>

                            <p> London Zoo was the home to one of the most famous animals in the world: 
                            Winnie-the-Pooh. Winnie was given to the zoo by a Canadian regiment who were called up to fight in 
                            France during the First World War. Winnie lived at ZSL London Zoo from 1914 until 1934 during which 
                            author AA Milne brought his son, Christopher Milne, to see Winnie. She quickly became Christopher 
                            Robin’s favourite animal at the zoo. Wait, she? It turns out the real Winnie was a female black bear 
                            rather than male and that very natural bear colour: yellow. She also probably didn’t eat honey or hang 
                            out with a piglet. </p>
